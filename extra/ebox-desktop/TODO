- Samba: Change the icon of the shares in the desktop ?

- Evolution is configured and working with the first user mail account
  but it has server settings hardcoded (IMAP, no-TLS, etc).

- Add firefox bookmarks for eGroupware webpage and eBox usercorner

- On the first version usercorner webpage will be hardcoded
  (https://ebox_ip:8888), later will be able to get a different port it has
  been changed.

- Pidgin: We have hardcoded 'ebox' as domain at first, and the proper
  username is set. The domain has to be set correctly if has been changed.

- Maybe in the future: ebox-printers?
