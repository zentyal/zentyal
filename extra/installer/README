How to create the Zentyal installation CD

1) Prepare your system

You need to export ZINSTALLER_ADDRESS and ZINSTALLER_KEYID on your ~/.bashrc
You can find commented examples in build_cd.conf

You also need to have the following packages installed:

build-essentials dpkg-dev devscripts mkisofs zentyal-common

2) Run ./autobuild

You will need to download the Ubuntu Server installers to remaster as you'll
be prompted to select them at the beginning of the generation process.
If you are not on a X11 environment, you'll have to copy them manually to
the build directory under ../build_installer.

3) Put extra ubuntu packages (optional, for custom installers only)

You must put all extra .deb archives in the directory pointed by the key
EXTRAS_DIR (in build_cd.conf).  Today the extra packages needed are all
Zentyal packages and its dependencies not already provided by the base CD.

You can put the packages you want included in the installer in the
'extra-packages.list' file and then use 'generate_extras.sh' script to get them
and their dependencies on a chrooted debootstrap environment.

You can also edit the sources.list file if you want to fetch the packages
from external repositories instead of manually copying the .deb files.

You can use 'build_cd.sh' inside a build directory to regenerate the ISO
image replacing the whole 'extras' directory.
