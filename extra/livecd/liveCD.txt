Shortcut:
  in files/ directory we have all files needed in points 4,8,9 and 10 so if you
  dont want to change anything you can copy them back or use them as template
  for your own modifications

Shortcut 2:
The buildLiveCD.sh script takes care of steps 3 to 12, but you must copy the
files/ directory to the same directory on which is placed the script in the host computer
