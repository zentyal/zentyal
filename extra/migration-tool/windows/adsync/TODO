Securization of password storage
--------------------------------
In the first proof of concept we store the passwords directly on disk.
It's more secure to store only in case of failure, two cases:
 - ebox-pwdsync-hook can't connect to ebox-pwdsync-service, it stores directly
   on disk and ebox-pwdsync-service will read it when it is alive again.
 - ebox-pwdsync-service receives the pass correctly through socket or
   something like that but fails when tries to send it to the eBox slaves,
   it stores the pass on disk until retries and receives the correct ACK.

More than one slave
-------------------
Currently only one eBox slave is support, to support more than once we have to:
 - Change the GUI to support that, a list instead of simple textboxes.
 - Modify the password-failure-storage system to take account of which slaves
   have exactly failed.

Remove references to passwdhk.dll in the registry when uninstalling
-------------------------------------------------------------------
It can be done adding a commandline argument to ebox-adsync-config.exe
so it will do that instead of showing the GUI.

Other FIXMEs and TODOs
----------------------
- vcredist is beign unpacked in c:\ instead of some temp dir
- Activate urlencode option for security reasons and decode it properly as it
  says in README.passwdhk.txt (done but needs testing)
- Replace urlencode with base64 encoding because the current urlencode doesn't
  seems to work with utf8.
- Add md5 or sha to the packet sent to eBox in order to check if the
  deciphering process was correct, that means that the passwords set are
  equal in both machines.
- Remove unused registry configuration values for passwdhk.dll
