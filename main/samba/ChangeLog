	+ DNS is now properly restarted after provision
3.1.6
	+ Fix Samba provisioning when joining an existing Windows server.

	  branches are not synced with samba or deleted from OpenLDAP by mistake.
	+ The Administrator user should be hidden.
3.1.5
	+ Adapted user-addon to right panel view

	+ Updated EBox::LDB class to use the new EBox::LDAPBase to share code.
