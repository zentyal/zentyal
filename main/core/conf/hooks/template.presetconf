# This is a sample presetconf script.

# presetconf scripts are run before the configuration for a given module is
# written. The module will check if an executable file called
# <module>.presetconf exists in /etc/zentyal/hooks and will try to run it

# Copy this file or create a script with the appropriate name if you want
# to run some customization script before a module writes its configuration

# Hook scripts need to be executable by root (note that examples are not).
