TEST DIRECTORIES
-----------

1.- 't'

   The tests in this directory will been executed by 'make check'. Of course, you may execute them manually using the Perl interpreter or the prove tool

2.- 'rootTests'

   The tests in this directory requires root permissions. So they won't be executed automatically with 'make check'; you must gain root status and execute them manually

3.- 'interactiveTests'

   The tests in this directory needs user interaction and some of them root permissions. They won't be executed by 'make check'; you must execute the manually and, in some cases, with root status
