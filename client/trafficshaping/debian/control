Description: Traffic shaper for eBox
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 This module adds a Traffic Shaper for eBox. So far, shape per service and
 per interface giving guaranteed bandwidth, limited bandwidth and traffic
 priorized. Only egress traffic is handled.
