Description: eBox - NTP server
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 .
 This module adds a NTP server to eBox, allowing time synchronization from
 external servers and to internal clients.
