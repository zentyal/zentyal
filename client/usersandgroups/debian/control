Description: eBox - User and Group management
 eBox is a framework for the development and deployment of security-wise
 network services in small and medium-sized networks, offering a simplified
 graphical interface to non expert users. It can be set up as a gateway,
 having some extra features over a usual router.
 .
 This module adds a LDAP server to your eBox installation, allowing you
 to add users and groups to be used by other eBox modules.
