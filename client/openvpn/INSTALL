INSTALLATION
-----------

** System setup

  1.- install the openvpn package
    $ apt-get install openvpn
   
    If the Debian package has not added a tun device in /dev/net, we must do it ourselves:

    $ [ -e /dev/net ] || mkdir -m 755 /dev/net	
    $ [ -d /dev/net -a ! -e /dev/net/tun ] && /bin/mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

 
  We must remove the symbolic links to /etc/init.d/openvpn in the /etc/rc?.d directories . We do this to avoid that the boot process starts and stop the openvpn servers
   
  $ update-rc.d -f openvpn remove

 2.- install the quagga package
     $ apt-get install quagga

  As we had done before with openvpn, we must remove the links used by the system to start quagga automatically
     $ update-rc.d -f quagga remove

  3.- Create Diffie-Hellaman parameters      
    The Diffie-Hellman parameters file is located at /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem. You can create it with OpenSSL   

   $ openssl dhparam -out /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem 1024

  4.- Setup nobody user and nogroup group 

    We had to make sure 'nobody' user and 'nogroup' group exists, if necessary we create them as system user/group.  In case we want to use another group or user we can do it changing the values of the relevant keys in eBox's GConf.

 5.- Module installation

    Now we are ready to follow the normal configuration and installation procedure:
    
	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --systemconfdir=/etc
	$ make install 

The last command must be executed as root user.
