      In order to set up VPN service, you first need to configure a
      Certification Authority. eBox also provides this service so you
      can build it up via

      OpenVPN module can configure eBox as OpenVPN server as well as
      client. As many servers/clients as you want may be
      configured.

    <title>Typical scenarios</title>
    <para>
      Since VPN is a quite complicated service, we illustrate with two typical
      scenarios how to configure them with eBox.
    </para>
    <section id="sect-roadwarrior">
	<title>Road warrior</title>
	<para>
	  You can set up eBox to support Road Warriors. That is, eBox
	  working as a gateway and an OpenVPN server, which has a
	  local area network (LAN) behind, letting clients connect to
	  eBox from WAN (road warriors) in order to access the
	  protected LAN via VPN service. The following figure could
	  show a better picture:
	</para>

	</figure>
	<para>
	  Our objective is to connect client 3 with the other two
	  far away clients (1 and 2) and last two each other.
	</para>
	<para>
	  First, we need to create the Certification Authority and
	  certificates for all elements present in the system, the
	  OpenVPN server and the two away clients. Here, this eBox acts
	  as well as Certification Authority.
	</para>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    To obtain detail information about eBox Certification Authority
	    module,<link linkend="ch-ca">check its own part in the manual.</link> 
	  </para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  Once we have the certificates, we should set up the
	  OpenVPN server in eBox at <guilabel>Create new
	  server</guilabel>. We should give it a name, a
	  protocol/port pair, a certificate (which have recently
	  created above) and a subnet to work with. The remainder
	  elements can be set by default values. As we see, the
	  OpenVPN server will be listening on all external
	  interfaces, so we need to set at least one of eBox
	  interfaces as external via
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guimenu>Network</guimenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Interfaces</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>
	  . In our scenario only two interfaces are needed, an internal
	  one for the LAN and an external one to work in
	  Internet.
	</para>
	<para>
	  After creating the OpenVPN server, we should enable the
	  service and save changes. Then, check out in
	  <guilabel>Status</guilabel> that there is an OpenVPN server
	  fully working.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Afterward, you should add advertised networks, which are
	  those which authorised OpenVPN clients will be able to access. In
	  order to achieve so, you need to have these advertised
	  networks reachable. You can set them on editing the chosen
	  OpenVPN server. In our scenario, you should add local
	  network to make visible client 3 to other two clients.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Now it is high time to configure clients. An OpenVPN
	  client may be configure using our bundles which are
          available in <guilabel>Servers</guilabel> table and click on
          <guiicon>Down arrow</guiicon> icon. Two Operating Systems
          bundles have been created, choose the one you use. If you
          are using a BSD-like environment such as
          <trademark>MacOS</trademark>, choose
          <emphasis>Linux</emphasis> system. Choose those client
          certificate to give to the client and set the external IP
          address to the VPN clients must connect. eBox will try to
          guess it using an Internet Web service. If the selected
          system is <trademark>Windows</trademark>, the OpenVPN
          installer for Win32 is included as well. It gives you an
          archive to be distributed to the client.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The bundle includes the configuration file and the required
          files to start the VPN connection. For instance, in Linux,
          just decompress the archive and run into the newly created
          directory the following command: <command>openvpn --config
	  filename</command>. Now you have access to client 3 from 
	  two remote clients. Connecting each other remote clients is
	  necessary to to set <guilabel>Allow client-to-client
	  connections</guilabel>  check-box within OpenVPN
	  server configuration. In order to check the configuration
	  is correct, you can see the routing table where advertised
	  networks are added to <literal>tapX</literal> virtual
	  interface.

    <section id="sect-two-offices">
      <title>Connect two offices with eBox and OpenVPN</title>
      <para>
	This second scenario tries to picture a common use case for
	eBox. Two offices in different networks require to be connected
	through a private network. To do so, we are going to use
	eBox in both local networks as gateways and one as an OpenVPN
	client and another as a server. The following figure tries to
	make clearer the situation:
      </para>
      <figure id="fig-ebox-vs-ebox">
	<title>eBox OpenVPN server vs. eBox OpenVPN client</title>

	</mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>
	Our aim is to connect client 1 in LAN 1 with client 2 in LAN 2
	as if they were under the same local network. Therefore we need
	to set up the OpenVPN server as we do in
	<xref linkend="sect-roadwarrior" />. However, just a pair of changes 
	is needed setting on option <literal>Allow eBox-to-eBox tunnels</literal> to exchange routes
	among eBox machines and <literal>eBox-to-eBox-tunnel
        password</literal> to perform a little more secure
        environment among the two offices.
      </para>
      <para>
	In order to configure eBox as OpenVPN client, we can do it at
	<guilabel>Create new client</guilabel> button within
	<guimenu>OpenVPN</guimenu> menu. We should set client's
	name and active. You may set the client configuration manually
        giving the required information or automatically using the
        bundle giving by the server as we have done in <xref
        linkend="sect-roadwarrior"/>. The former requires the server service
        address, required certificates and server's tunnel password as
        well, and the latter this information is extracted
        automatically from the bundle. When you save
	changes, in status summary, you can see the new OpenVPN
	daemon in LAN 2 running as a client with the connection target to the
	other eBox within LAN 1.
