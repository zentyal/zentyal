		<title>Firewall in eBox</title>

		<para>
		  One of the most important features in eBox is its firewall
		  module. You can access it through
		  <menuchoice>
		    <guimenu>Firewall</guimenu>
		  </menuchoice>
		  . There you can make packet filtering (<xref
		  linkend='sect-fw-filter' />) or port
		  redirection (<xref linkend='sect-fw-redirects'/>).
		</para>

		<para>
                 The firewall has different behaviour with 
		external or internal network interfaces.
		<!--TODO: qué hace eBox con los interfaces externos-->
		</para>

                <para>
                 The internal interfaces are connected to local
                 networks. They had not restrictions as the
                 external interfaces have.
                </para>

                <para>
                The external interfaces are connected to external
                networks and eBox only allows redirections from them.

		<title>Port Redirects</title>

		<para>Port redirects allow to get external traffic
		into a host behind a eBox system with firewall module
		installed. You can get the configuration of these
		options at
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Firewall</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Redirects</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		.
		</para>

		<para>
		If you need to add a new redirect, first select your
		desired <guilabel>Interface</guilabel> which will
		listen incoming connections. This should be one of the
		interfaces previously selected as external. Moreover,
		it should be assigned the <guilabel>External
		port</guilabel> where you expect your incoming
		traffic, and the <guilabel>protocol</guilabel> that
		will be used.</para>

		<para>You should enter the destination system
		<guilabel>IP address</guilabel> and its
		<guilabel>Port</guilabel> where packets would go
		on.</para>
	        
		<para>Once you have selected this data, you just need
		to select between the different
		<guilabel>Actions</guilabel>, the
		<guilabel>Add</guilabel> one, and click on it.</para>
				
		<para>To remove a rule, you should select remove
		between the available <guilabel>Actions</guilabel>,
		and click on it.</para>

		<para>Redirect configuration can be modified by
		changing its parameters and clicking on their modify
		<guilabel>Actions</guilabel>.</para>

		<!-- Firewall->Packet Filter -->
		<title>Packet filter</title>

		<para>
		From
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Firewall</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Packet filter</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		you can configure packet filter rules. You may use the
                abstractions provided above such as <link
                linkend="ch-services">network services</link> and
                <link linkend="ch-objects">network objects</link>.
                Using these concepts enhances
                the rules flexibility and clearness, reducing the amount.

                <para>At first sight, we have five different traffic flows

                Take into account to the last two set of rules that it
                is granted access to untrusted networks to your
                managed networks. This may compromise your network
                security. As eBox secure by default policy recommends,
                do not modify these rules unless you know what you are
                doing. The figure <xref
                linkend="fig-firewall"/> try to make up the concept:

		<para>The deny policy for eBox firewall is a
                ignorance one. Every denied packet is filtered and
                discarded without any notification.</para>

                <para>Every set of rules define a fixed behaviour for
                the traffic flows that they apply. These rules will be
                matched from top to the bottom, thus order is
                important. Each rule consists of these following fields, some of
                them are only available to several rule set by
